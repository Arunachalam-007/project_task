//3.
		//Abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods. but interface can have
		//only abstract methods.
		
		//Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.whereas interface 
		//support multiple inheritance.
		
		//An abstract class can be extended using extends keyword.interface can be implemented 
		//using implements keyword.
		
		//Abstract class is more powerful when we implement inheritance.
		
		//An abstract class is also good if we want to declare non-public members.
		
		
	
 //4.
	
	//Two types of polymorphism
	
			//1.Overloading
			//2.Overriding
	//Overloading
			//When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters 
			//Functions can be overloaded by change in the number of arguments and 
			//a change in the type of arguments.
	//Overriding
			//When a derived class has a definition for one of the member
			//functions of the base class.
	
	
//5.
	//Three main features of OOPs
		//Encapsulation
		//Inheritance
		//Polymorphism
	
//6. Objects
	//Objects is a instance of a class.Objects are created at runtime.Each objects has an
	//Identity,Behavior and State.
	//All objects are dynamically allocated on heap.When we declare a variable of a class,
	//Only reference is created and memory is not allocated for the object.

	
//7. Inheritance 
	//It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors 
	//of a parent object.We can derive child class(Sub class) from parent class(Super class).
	
	//Types of Inheritance
		//Single inheritance
		//Multi-level inheritance
		//Hierarchical inheritance
	
//8. Constructor
	//A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 
	//The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
	//It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
	
	//Types of Constructor
		//Default Constructor
		//Parameterized Constructor
	
//9.Steps to connect JDBC
	//Import the package
	//Load and Register the Driver
	//Establish the connection
	//Create the statement
	//Execute the query
	//Process the result
	//close the connection
	
//10.Maven 
	//Maven is a popular open source build tool for enterprise projects designed to take much of 
	//the hard work out of the build process.Maven uses a declarative approach where the 
	//project structure and contents are described.The popular Maven repository contains 
	//all the packages.
	
//12.This Keyword
		//It is used to refer current class instance as well as static members and 
		//to invoke or initiate current class constructor.
		//can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
	//Super Keyword
		//Super keyword is used to access methods and data members of the parent class
		//while this is used to access methods of the current class.
	
//13.Naming conventions
	//Packages - small alphabetic
	//Class- upper camelcase alphabetic
	//Interface - Upper camelcase
	//Variable - lower camelcase alphabetic
	//Method - lower camelcase alphabetic
	
//14.List, Set, Map
	//List allow duplicate elements. set does not allow duplicate elements, map does not 
	//allow duplicate elements.
	//In list, we can add any number of null values.But in set almost one null values.
	//The map allows a single null key at most and any number of null values.
	//list-(Array list,Linked list) set-(Hash set,Tree set) map-(Hash map,Tree map)
	
//15. Generics
	//Generics is a parameterized type.Using generics it is possible to create classes
	//that work with different data types.
		//Generic methods
		//Generic classes
	//Example 
		//public List<Student> displayData(){}
